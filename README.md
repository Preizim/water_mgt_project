Water Management System using ESP32
Overview
This project is an IoT based water management system that uses an ESP32 microcontroller, ultrasonic sensor, solenoid valves, and a pump to control water flow based on user payments. The system includes a web interface where users can authenticate, make payments, and monitor water usage. Administrators have access to additional controls and monitoring features via a backend server.

The ESP32 communicates with the frontend  server over WiFi using REST APIs . The system is designed to automate water flow control while maintaining user and admin interactions via the web interface.

Components
ESP32: Microcontroller responsible for controlling sensors, valves, and communicating with the server.
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04): Used to monitor water levels in a tank.
Solenoid Valve: Controls water flow.
Pump: Pumps water based on control signals from the ESP32.
Web Interface: User-facing frontend where payments and water requests are handled.
Backend Server (Node.js): Handles authentication, payment processing, and system monitoring.
LCD: it displays the water level

Features
User Authentication: Users can log in using credentials.
Payment Integration: Users can pay for water through the system.
Automated Water Flow: Once payment is verified, the system allows a predefined quantity of water to flow through the solenoid valve.
Real-time Water Monitoring: The system measures the current water level using the ultrasonic sensor.
Admin Control: Admins can manually turn on/off the pump and view system status through the web interface.
Database (MySQL): Stores user data, payment records, and system logs.
XAMPP: Cross-platform software for running Apache, MySQL, and PHP locally for the backend.

Prerequisites
Hardware:

ESP32 microcontroller
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
Solenoid valve (connected to a relay)
Water pump
Jumper wires and breadboard
Software:

Arduino IDE with ESP32 support
MySQLi database for backend server
HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend

Setup Instructions
1. ESP32 Setup
Install Arduino IDE (if not already installed) from here.
Install ESP32 Board Support:
Go to File -> Preferences.
Add the URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json in the "Additional Boards Manager URLs".
Go to Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager, search for ESP32, and install the package.
Install Required Libraries:
WiFi.h
HTTPClient.h
Configure ESP32 Code:
Copy and paste the ESP32 code into your Arduino sketch.
Replace the placeholders for your_SSID, your_PASSWORD, and your_server_ip with your actual network details.
Upload the Code:
Select the correct board (ESP32) and port in the Arduino IDE.
Click the upload button.
2. Backend Setup
download xampp from online
Install Xampp
Xampp contains the database platform we will be using for the project (MySQLi Database)
Start Xampp (when the interface opens , start Apache and MySQLi)
Go to chrome and search "localhost/phpmyadmin". it should link you to the database.
You can now create a database for your project. For this project, we used "water_management"
You will also need to create other tables need to collect the required information.
note that the backend code is written in php


3. Frontend Setup
Basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript:
Create a simple web interface for users to authenticate and pay for water.
The frontend sends requests to the backend 


4. Connecting Hardware
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04):
Connect VCC to 3.3V on ESP32, GND to GND, Trig to GPIO 5, and Echo to GPIO 18.
Solenoid Valve:
Connect to ESP32 through a relay. GPIO 4 controls the relay.
Pump:
Connect the pump to the ESP32, using a relay connected to GPIO 16.
5. Running the System
Start the ESP32: Power the ESP32 and ensure it connects to WiFi.
The default Hotspot name used in this project is "Preizim"
and the password used is "123456789"
to avoid changing the code, you can name the deice to be used as hotspot following the above.


Access the Web Interface: the whole folder to be used for the project has to be inside htdocs folder inside the xampp folder eg xampp/htdocs/your_folder
Monitor the Serial Output: Open the Arduino Serial Monitor to see log outputs from the ESP32.
Control Water Flow: After successful payment,the admin approves the water then the ESP32 will control the solenoid valve and pump to release the specified quantity of water.

How It Works
User Authentication: Users log in through the web interface, sending credentials to the backend, which returns authentication status.
Payment Processing: After login, users can initiate a payment request. The backend processes the payment and returns success or failure.
Water Flow Control: Upon successful payment, the admin approves the water then the ESP32 opens the solenoid valve and activates the pump, allowing water to flow.
Water Monitoring: The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the water level in the tank, which is displayed on the admin dashboard and the LCD.
Code Structure
ESP32 Code: Handles sensor readings, WiFi connection, and HTTP requests to the backend server.
Backend Server : Provides authentication and payment APIs.
Frontend (HTML/JS): User-facing interface for payments and admin controls.

6. XAMPP MySQL Database Setup
Download and Install XAMPP from here.

Start XAMPP:

Open XAMPP and start the Apache and MySQL modules.
Create a Database:

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
Click Databases and create a new database named water_management.
Create Tables:

Go to the water_management database.
Run the following SQL queries to create tables for users, payments, and water usage:
